This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4864

This script contains two vim files: "c.vim" and "workpath.vim".
"workpath.vim" is used to set the current work path, which contains
source code you want to edit and relative tags file. It works together with
the other syntax script "c.vim". "c.vim" searches the tags file to identify
different syntax items, such as macros, typedefs, structs, enums, etc. So, if
you want to use the "c.vim" to highlight your C programs, you need to assign
the work path which contains the tags file of your C programs.
